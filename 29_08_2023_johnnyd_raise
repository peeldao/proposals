##Proposal Date:##
18th September, 2023.

##Thesis:##
Increase the payout to Big Fundamentals Tech (JohnnyD) from $US3600 to $US4900.

##Motivation:##
Align the compensation with the value of the results I have provided the last 3-months and will continue to provide.

##Specification:##
Increase the payout to the V2 Juicebox project @johnnyd from $US3600 to $US4900.

##Rationale:##
Before our last payout period, Peel agreed to a top-line Peeler rate of US$5k/week. I believe I have delivered to this standard we set, and plan to continue doing so.
I have fulfilled everything in my last proposal  (https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/pull/58/files) and more, including:
- Lead the development of and delivered a bug-free settings page overhaul: 
    - Delivered the new *edit cycle form* end-to-end including the new payouts table, making design choices where necessary (https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1080714793595441182/1140571158446620802), and presented it to the community.
    - Delivered the new *launch NFTs flow* from the `/settings/nfts` page.
- Consistently squashed bugs.
- Consistent and timely reviews for other devs.

##Outcomes (personal OKR):##
1. Transform JBM into a true "Etherscan of JB": make it as bug-free and reliable as humanly possible. 
2. Transform JBM to facilitate the soon-to-be dApps ecosystem of Juicebox. 
3. Facilitate essential contract updates. 
4. Deliver what the Peel team to be *essential* feature requests to JBM.

##Terms:##

- I commit to delivering the listed outcomes at the agreed price, regardless of how long the work takes.
- If there are errors or issues with the delivery of the outcomes, I agree to resolve those issues at no additional expense.
- I agree to use my own equipment to perform all work.

##Timeline:##
Starting immediately and continuing until the following Peel/JB proposal (~3 months from now).

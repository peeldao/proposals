Proposal 


Retroactive one time payout for Sticklo: @sticklo $1000 for work done since 23/03/2022


I humbly submit this proposal for a retroactive one time payout for work done on the JBX frontend through Peel since the last week of March 2022. 


-Code Contribution:  I  worked on  bug fixes and implementing small features. Aside from being a junior coder, the tech stack used in the codebase is relatively new to me and  I had to  spend a lot of time learning to do what I have to do to submit a successful PR.

- Time spent: I averaged about 8hrs of work weekly. 

Discord Discussion: I have mostly been observing while listening in at town hall meetings and stuff as I am still very new to web3, with a bit of interactions here and there in the discord, however, I am keen to become more involved in Peel and Juicebox in general.

I'm also keen to learning more about how web3 applications work

- Proof of work: I could not figure out a way to add all of my commits from my fork and my direct contributions to the repo so I just put my PRs in a google doc instead I hope that's okay  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3PuuEYDFwqeYqZbUiyEqihMJW0Poolk-p751WVTBDU/edit?usp=sharing

- Governance: This is another avenue where I'm excited and willing  to participate in its discourse and see where it can go.

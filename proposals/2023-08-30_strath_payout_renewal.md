# Strath Payout Renewal


### **Proposal date:**

August 30th 2023

### **Thesis**

Renew Strath’s recurring payout at US$5000 per cycle. *

### **Motivation**

As Peel navigates a roadmap pivot and shift our focus toward the creation of targeted apps and tailored experiences, the role of a dedicated and skilled designer will be essential to achieving success. I believe I am the best person to fill this role and am looking forward to working tirelessly to achieve our goals and elevate the Juicebox protocol to the next level through the design of these new and innovative apps.

### **Specification**

Continue to provide US$5000 in ETH per funding cycle as compensation to solrising.eth (PT. SOL RISING VENTURES) (0x1E2B964Ddfed2bD32b99513ac2357B7B0c3ed94f) in return for exceptional UX & UI Design. With the expectation for Strath to contribute at a full-time capacity.

### **Rationale**

Having actively contributed to PeelDAO for over a year I have an in-depth understanding of the Juicebox protocol which allows me to work fast and efficiently to align user needs and protocol features. Throughout the past 3 months, I believe my contribution has added significant value to both Juicebox and Peel, through high-level visual and user experience design, research & strategy. 

**A few examples include:**

- Complete overhaul and redesign of the JBM create flow based on feedback and data from the past 6 months. (Ready for handover.)

- Finished redesign and ongoing improvement of new Juicebox project page and new checkout system.

- Delivering on the Product roadmap outlined by TJL.
- Design direction and mockups of targeted front ends for the Juicebox protocol.

- Collaborating with TJL and JonhnnyD on improving project settings.

- Overseeing all parts of the Juicebox design process.
- Ongoing updates and maintenance of the Juicebox design system (colours, components, organisation etc) used as the building blocks and guide for all future design on JBM and beyond.

- Keeping up with UX issues and feedback in Discord and consistently delivering solutions, giving advice and actioning various UX/UI design tasks as they emerge throughout the product.
- User interviews and testing + monitoring hotjar and other analytics tools to gather data from real users and inform design decisions.

**Over the next 12 funding cycles my focus will be:**

- Leading the design effort in building targeted front ends for the Juicebox protocol.
- Delivering on the updated roadmap with ‘Targeted dApps’ etc.
- Necessary updates and improvements to JBM to ensure a smooth running ship.
- Refinement of overall JBM user experience based on critical feedback and data as we transition to building new dApps.
- Consistently talking to users to gather as much valuable insight and data as possible for what we are building.
- Collaborating with development team to ensure our products are always polished and usable.

I am confident in my ability to deliver on this proposal and execute the list of priorities outlined above. Really looking forward to continuing my work within the Peel team.

### **Risks**

- I don’t deliver enough meaningful work during this period
- Overspending of the Peel/Juicebox treasury

### **Timeline**

Starting at Peel V3 FC#35 (September 4th 2023) and continuing until December 18th 2023  (roughly in line with the duration of our JuiceboxDAO proposal and payout).

### * Notes

- Payout amount is pending outcome of Peel’s JBDAO proposal (with the assumption it will be renewed at $60K). If anything changes with the Peel payout, I am happy to revisit and renegotiate the payout amount and terms of this proposal.

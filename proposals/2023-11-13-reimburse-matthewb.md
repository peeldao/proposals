### Proposal date
November 13, 2023

### tldr;
Reimburse Matthew for expenses incurred during the Juicecrowd 01 (JC01) campaign.

### Motivation
I have incurred costs throughout the recent Juicecrowd sprint including Twitter Blue/Premium, ad placements, and Gitbook. Expenses were agreed upon informally in Discord and we needed to move quickly so I covered these costs.

### Rationale
- I have paid 16.93 USD so far for Twitter Premium (Sep 15, 2023 and Oct 15, 2023) and will pay for Nov 15, 2023 so that we are covered until Dec 15, 2023. **Total is 25.26 USD.**
- I paid 0.4 ETH + gas ([txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa98aade143f86a212e7a39bcf0deb3f5f2aa6ae50a8413c0cbc145a557617264)) to the Web3 Galaxy Brain project for ad placements. Nicholas later declined to proceed with the ads and returned the funds to the Peel project ([txn](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe977d589bae5527da48d90a1973acd13b10ce2940f7b3f2b180c97dc7ce4d54e)). **Total is 0.40221228941 ETH.**
- I have paid for Twitter ads starting from Oct 24, 2023 to Nov 08, 2023. Early ad placement tests using Quick Promote underperformed but later campaigns were very successful with 2.5M+ impressions and 3000+ clicks. **Total is 792.43 USD.**
- I have paid 16.00 USD so far for Gitbook (Oct 31, 2023) and will pay for Nov 31, 2023 so that we are covered until Dec 31, 2023. **Total is 32.00 USD.**

## Summary

Renew benjamin's recurring payout for the next 15 FC's

## Specification

Renew benjamin's @ US$700/week (starting in Peel FC#45 ending at FC#62)
($100 reduction per fc)

Additionally, looking to not contribute the last two weeks of Dec. Per my light contributions I don't feel I should be on the FC payout list (PTO) during my time off as full-time contributors are.

## Rationale

Continue providing part-time support

## The Role

An part-time individual contributor role at roughly 5-6 hours a week.

## Responsibility

My role is primarily a limited support role. Either fixing bugs, upgrading parts of the code base, contributing to technical discussion and decisions, and upgrading dependencies in the application.

## Compensation

I believe my compensation is fair and within general market range.

Granted some weeks I can be a little more involved than others, just depending on schedule. I strive to meet my contribution commitment consistently.

Work Completed / Contributions since last proposal

## Current Work In Progress:

### Find and fix issues pertaining to performance

- Looked into possible issues with bundling pertaining to the project's use of barrel files. (Note: tested a couple of different times breaking up barrel files but it wasn't an issue)
- Add client side Error Boundary
- Add bundle analyzer and figure out ways bundle size can be broken down with js lazy loaded.
- Looked into (with a fix on my local machine to reduce very large images on the landing page)
- Lazy loading landing page
- breaking up wallet / account hooks to load lazily

### Product Work

- Social Icons refresh on the project page.

### Past

- ID'ed possible security issue and notified relevant contributors
- typed env variables
- various refactors
- re-implemented the site navigation to prep for antd, and react 18
- refactor mobile query hook.
- fix owner asset bug in v2 hook
- update imgs to use next/image
- various documentation updates
- Added Transactor error states on more critical user flows in the application

### Unsuccessful but worth mentioning

- Spent time trying to update create-react-app. Turned out that it wasn't worth the headache and nextjs was a better decision.
- Spent time trying to upgrade react versions. Found antd to be a blocking requirement
- Abstracting transaction errors: Tried to come up with a move generic solution, but wasn't possible.

## Scope of work moving forward

### Work

Continue working on similar type tasks that either improve the quality of life for engineering, fix bugs/regressions, update packages, help site perf.

### Team

help decentralize peel by participating in dao activities (signing transactions and voting)

### Meetings

While I've been noticeably absent from meetings I communicate status and work on standup channel if I'm not able to make meetings. I'm hoping in the new year I'll have less conflicts with Peel sync weekly meetings

SEO Process:
Technical SEO Audits-Making sure that the site's pages, its information architecture, and its content taxonomies are conducive for search engine bot crawls. Performing the following tasks regularly ensures a high level of on-site optimization:
Meta description audits
Robots.txt validations
Link profile analysis
Internal linking audits
Duplicate content audits
Weak/thin content page audits
Crawl error audits
Sitemap check

Fix Technical Issues- Ensuring that the site's current technical state allows search engine bots to crawl public-facing pages freely is an integral aspect of SEO. I'll coordinate and sync with  website developers (PeelDAO) to address concern areas such as crawl errors, internal linking, sitemap creation, to make sure crawls run smoothly and internal link equity is properly distributed.
Build Up Link Profile- Inbound links from relevant, high-quality websites will help maximize the website's ranking potential. By using a variety of tactics I'll make efforts to encourage authority sites to link to the projects' web pages.

Content Development and Social Media- Google's algorithms reward websites that look like an established brand. Leveraging high quality content by consistently cross-posting across social media accounts increases project awareness and promotes brand narrative, while attracting more visitors to the website.

Keywords/Meta-Tags- Keyword research identifies target queries, and analyzes the existing search engine results pages (SERPs). Through keyword research and mapping we can then incorporate the researched words into target pages that the project would like to see rank as title tags, meta descriptions, and website headings.
